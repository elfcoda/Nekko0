[00:20.510]Raging wind while your visage fades away
[00:31.230]Where the world lies in pieces at my feet
[00:40.510]
[00:42.060]The fire and the storm and the snow and the mist
[00:52.720]Struggle inside，help me gain insight
[01:02.440]
[01:03.350]Hail my proud queen ，on and on on and on
[01:08.310]That wax and wane showed its ebb and flow
[01:14.090]Selah，selah，are chanting evermore
[01:19.470]Hear，oh hear all the voices trapped in thee
[01:26.110]
[01:37.130]See myself in your eyes that’s colorless
[01:47.630]Visions pass and emotions run through me
[01:57.990]
[01:58.410]Struggle inside，helped me gain insight
[02:08.880]
[02:09.230]Hail my proud queen ，on and on on and on
[02:14.130]That wax and wane showed its ebb and flow
[02:19.970]Selah，selah，are chanting evermore
[02:25.420]Hear，oh hear all the voices trapped in thee
[02:31.530]
[02:35.860]Fair moonlight，will you fill my void eyes？
[02:42.760]Hail my proud queen ，on and on...
[02:48.210]Hail my proud queen ，on and on...

[00:20.510]当你的面容枯萎 飓风大作
[00:31.230]这便是在我脚下粉碎的世界
[00:40.510]
[00:42.060]烈火与风暴，降雪与迷雾
[00:52.720]忍痛于怀，辅我知觉
[01:02.440]
[01:03.350]女王万岁 不绝于耳
[01:08.310]阴晴圆缺有其涨落
[01:14.090]休止声声无休无止
[01:19.470]侧耳倾听汝之心声
[01:26.110]
[01:37.130]在你的失色的瞳仁中我看见自己
[01:47.630]幻觉过后我的情感倾泻而出
[01:57.990]
[01:58.410]忍痛于怀，辅我知觉
[02:08.880]
[02:09.230]女王万岁 不绝于耳
[02:14.130]阴晴圆缺有其涨落
[02:19.970]休止声声无休无止
[02:25.420]侧耳倾听汝之心声
[02:31.530]
[02:35.860]公义之月，你会盈满我空洞的目光吗？
[02:42.760]女王万岁 不绝于耳
[02:48.210]女王万岁 不绝于耳
[02:53.290]
[02:53.580]休止声声无休无止
[02:58.950]侧耳倾听汝之心声
